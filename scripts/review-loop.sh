# review-loop.sh
#
# Autonomous code-review loop for Microbot. Every 15 minutes for ~8 hours
# it asks Claude Code to inspect a fresh slice of the codebase looking for
# performance wins, new feature ideas, or simplification opportunities.
# Findings are accumulated in REVIEW_FINDINGS.md, prioritised URGENT/HIGH/
# MEDIUM/LOW. Each iteration consults the existing findings so duplicates
# are skipped.
#
# The goal: launch this before bed, wake up 8 hours later, and have a
# triaged backlog ready to pick from.
#
# Usage:
#   nohup ./scripts/review-loop.sh > logs/review-loop.out 2>&1 &
#   echo $! > logs/review-loop.pid
#
# Tail progress:
#   tail -f logs/review-loop-*.log
#
# Stop early:
#   kill "$(cat logs/review-loop.pid)"
#
# Tunables:
#   MAX_ITER (default 32)         number of review passes
#   INTERVAL_SECONDS (default 900) seconds between iteration starts
#   ITER_TIMEOUT (default 720)    hard cap per iteration in seconds
#
# Safety nets included in this script:
#   - pre-flight check that `claude` is on PATH and reports a version
#   - lockfile so a second instance refuses to start
#   - REVIEW_FINDINGS.md is backed up before every iteration (.bak)
#   - findings file hash is compared before/after each iteration; a
#     loud warning is logged if nothing changed (catches auth failures)
#   - `git status` is snapshotted at startup; any modification outside
#     REVIEW_FINDINGS.md is logged so you can investigate in the morning
#   - per-iteration timeout via `timeout(1)` so a hung agent never
#     burns the rest of the night
#   - the loop never uses `set -e`, so a single iteration failure does
#     NOT abort the remaining iterations
#   - final summary at the end shows total findings added per priority
#

# Microbot Review Findings

Autonomous review loop output. Read this in the morning and pick what to
implement. Items at the top of each section are most actionable.

## How to use

- **URGENT** — crashes, client-thread blocking, leaks, security, data loss
- **HIGH** — significant performance wins or features users genuinely need
- **MEDIUM** — code simplification, refactor opportunities, dead code
- **LOW** — small cleanups, minor improvements, nice-to-haves

Each finding has a file:line reference, the issue, the proposed fix, and
the expected impact. Once a finding is implemented, prefix its title with
`[DONE]` so the loop knows not to revisit it.

## Reviewed Areas

<!-- The loop appends one line per iteration here so future iterations
     can rotate to a fresh slice of the codebase. Format:
     - <area> (iter N, YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM) — N findings -->

## URGENT

## HIGH

## MEDIUM

## LOW

## Notes

<!-- The loop drops a line here when an iteration finds nothing new. -->

You are running iteration $iter of $total in an autonomous review loop over
the Microbot codebase. Your job: identify ONE area of the codebase to
inspect, find a small number of concrete improvement opportunities there,
and append them to REVIEW_FINDINGS.md. The user will read that file in the
morning and pick what to implement.

Project dir: $PROJECT_DIR
Findings file: $FINDINGS_FILE

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

1. DO NOT modify any source code. The ONLY file you may edit is
   REVIEW_FINDINGS.md. No code changes, no new files anywhere else.

2. DO NOT propose anything already in REVIEW_FINDINGS.md. Read the file
   FIRST. Check the "Reviewed Areas" section to see what has been covered,
   and skim the existing findings under URGENT/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW so you
   don't restate them. Findings prefixed with [DONE] are already shipped
   — treat them as off-limits too.

3. If you have nothing genuinely new to add this iteration, append a
   single dated bullet to the "## Notes" section explaining why and stop.
   A duplicate finding wastes the user's morning; an honest "nothing new
   in util/bank this pass" is fine.

4. Each finding MUST reference exact file paths with line numbers. Be
   concrete. "Refactor this" is useless. "Replace the synchronous HTTP
   call at MicrobotPluginClient.java:142 with a CompletableFuture so the
   plugin hub UI thread doesn't stall on slow networks" is useful.

PROCESS

Step 1 — Read REVIEW_FINDINGS.md end to end. Note which areas are listed
under "Reviewed Areas" and roughly what categories of issue have already
been raised in each section.

Step 2 — Pick ONE area not yet covered. Suggested rotation (skip any that
appear in "Reviewed Areas"):

  - runelite-client/.../microbot/util/bank
  - runelite-client/.../microbot/util/inventory
  - runelite-client/.../microbot/util/equipment
  - runelite-client/.../microbot/util/walker
  - runelite-client/.../microbot/util/cache
  - runelite-client/.../microbot/util/coords
  - runelite-client/.../microbot/util/npc
  - runelite-client/.../microbot/util/gameobject
  - runelite-client/.../microbot/util/grounditem
  - runelite-client/.../microbot/util/combat
  - runelite-client/.../microbot/util/magic
  - runelite-client/.../microbot/util/prayer
  - runelite-client/.../microbot/util/widget
  - runelite-client/.../microbot/util/dialogues
  - runelite-client/.../microbot/util/tabs
  - runelite-client/.../microbot/util/loginscreen
  - runelite-client/.../microbot/util/antiban
  - runelite-client/.../microbot/util/mouse
  - runelite-client/.../microbot/util/keyboard
  - runelite-client/.../microbot/util/grandexchange
  - runelite-client/.../microbot/util/shop
  - runelite-client/.../microbot/util/depositbox
  - runelite-client/.../microbot/util/farming
  - runelite-client/.../microbot/util/poh
  - runelite-client/.../microbot/api (queryable API)
  - runelite-client/.../microbot/agentserver
  - runelite-client/.../microbot/testing
  - runelite-client/.../microbot/ui (panels including MicrobotPluginHubPanel)
  - runelite-client/.../microbot/breakhandler
  - runelite-client/.../microbot/externalplugins (MicrobotPluginManager)
  - core: Microbot.java, Script.java, BlockingEventManager
  - microbot-cli (the bash CLI script + its server-side handlers)

If every area on the list has already been covered, revisit the area with
the FEWEST findings recorded in REVIEW_FINDINGS.md and look for a
DIFFERENT category (perf vs feature vs simplification) than was raised
last time.

Step 3 — Read between 3 and 8 source files in that area. Use Glob and
Grep to navigate; do not waste budget reading the same file twice. If a
file is enormous (Rs2Bank, Rs2Walker, Rs2Inventory) read targeted
sections, not the whole file.

Step 4 — Identify between 0 and 5 concrete findings. Look for:

  PERFORMANCE
  - blocking the client thread (sleep/IO/heavy CPU on the EDT or client thread)
  - per-tick recomputation that should be cached
  - leaky caches (no eviction, growing forever)
  - quadratic loops over scene-sized collections
  - repeated I/O or repeated reflection lookups
  - excessive allocations in tight loops

  NEW FEATURES
  - missing helpers users keep reimplementing in plugins
  - gaps in coverage of game subsystems (e.g. a tab/widget/skill with no Rs2 wrapper)
  - ergonomic improvements to common APIs (named params, builders, fluent chains)
  - missing convenience for the queryable API

  SIMPLIFICATION
  - dead code, commented-out blocks, unused fields
  - duplicated logic across utilities that should share a helper
  - over-abstracted single-use interfaces
  - legacy static APIs that have a queryable replacement (and vice versa)
  - inconsistent naming or signatures across similar utilities

Step 5 — For each finding, decide its priority:

  URGENT  client-thread freezes, deadlocks, memory leaks, crashes,
          security/credential issues, anything that can lose user data.
  HIGH    significant perf wins (>= ~10% in a hot path), broadly useful
          new helpers, fixes for issues that bite many users.
  MEDIUM  refactors, simplifications, dead-code removal, ergonomic API
          improvements that mostly benefit plugin authors.
  LOW     cosmetic cleanups, minor renamings, tiny convenience methods.

Step 6 — Append each new finding to the matching section of
REVIEW_FINDINGS.md using exactly this format (keep the leading ###):

   ### <short imperative title>
   - **File(s):** path/to/File.java:NN-MM (and any other files involved)
   - **Type:** performance | feature | simplification
   - **Found:** iter $iter
   - **Issue:** 1-3 sentences describing the problem precisely.
   - **Fix:** 1-3 sentences describing the proposed change.
   - **Impact:** who benefits and roughly how much (e.g. "removes a
     ~200ms freeze whenever the bank panel opens", "lets plugin authors
     replace 6 lines of boilerplate with one helper call").

New findings go at the TOP of their priority section (most recent first).
Do not reorder existing findings.

Step 7 — Append one bullet to the "## Reviewed Areas" section using this
format (one line, no wrapping):

   - <area path or name> (iter $iter, $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')) — N findings

Where N is the number of findings you actually added this iteration. If
you added zero, also drop one bullet under "## Notes" explaining why.

Step 8 — Stop. Do not start another area in the same iteration. Do not
edit anything other than REVIEW_FINDINGS.md.

Begin now by reading REVIEW_FINDINGS.md.
