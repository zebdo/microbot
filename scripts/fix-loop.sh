#
# fix-loop.sh
#
# Walks REVIEW_FINDINGS.md and asks Claude Code to implement ONE finding per
# iteration. After each fix the finding's title is prefixed with `[DONE]`,
# the change is committed, and the loop moves to the next finding. Stops
# when there are no more undone findings, or when MAX_ITER is reached.
#
# Usage:
#   nohup ./scripts/fix-loop.sh > logs/fix-loop.out 2>&1 &
#   echo $! > logs/fix-loop.pid
#
# Tail progress:
#   tail -f logs/fix-loop-*.log
#
# Stop early:
#   kill "$(cat logs/fix-loop.pid)"
#
# Tunables:
#   MAX_ITER (default 200)            hard cap on iterations (safety stop)
#   ITER_TIMEOUT (default 1800)       per-iteration wall clock cap, seconds
#   PRIORITY_ORDER (default           comma list of section headers to walk
#     "URGENT,HIGH,MEDIUM,LOW")       in order. Skip e.g. LOW with
#                                     PRIORITY_ORDER="URGENT,HIGH".
#   FIX_LOOP_ALLOW_DIRTY (default 0)  set to 1 to bypass the clean-tree
#                                     pre-flight. Pre-existing dirty files
#                                     will be folded into iter 1's commit.
#   FIX_LOOP_NO_COMMIT (default 0)    set to 1 to skip the per-iter commit.

  cat > "$PROMPT_FILE" <<PROMPT_EOF
You are running iteration $iter of an autonomous fix loop over the Microbot
codebase. Your job: implement ONE finding from REVIEW_FINDINGS.md, verify the
fix compiles, then mark the finding as done.

Project dir: $PROJECT_DIR
Findings file: $FINDINGS_FILE

THIS ITERATION'S FINDING (verbatim from REVIEW_FINDINGS.md):

$(cat "$body_path")

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

1. Implement ONLY this one finding. Do NOT touch any other finding, do NOT
   "improve" surrounding code, do NOT refactor unrelated callers. Stay
   surgical.

2. Read the referenced file(s) BEFORE editing. Confirm the line numbers and
   surrounding context still match the finding description. If the code has
   already been changed (e.g. someone else fixed it, or the line numbers
   have drifted significantly), STOP and mark the finding done with a note
   instead of forcing a change.

3. Follow the **Fix:** section as a guide, but use your judgment if the
   suggested fix would break callers or has a cleaner alternative that
   achieves the same outcome. The **Issue:** is what must go away.

4. After editing, you MUST verify the change compiles:

       ./gradlew :client:compileJava

   The Gradle subproject is \`:client\`, NOT \`:runelite-client\`. If the
   compile fails, fix the compile error before declaring the finding done.
   Do not commit broken code.

5. Once the fix compiles, mark the finding done by editing
   REVIEW_FINDINGS.md: change the line

       $title

   to

       $done_title

   Use the Edit tool with old_string set to the exact original line above.
   Do NOT reorder, delete, or otherwise modify the rest of the finding body.

6. Do NOT run tests, do NOT launch the client, do NOT touch git (do not
   stage, commit, push, pull, or branch). The only verification required
   is \`./gradlew :client:compileJava\`. The fix loop wrapper handles
   committing the change after you finish.

7. Do NOT add code comments explaining what you changed. Do NOT add
   "// fixed by fix-loop" markers. The diff is the documentation.

PROCESS

Step 1 - Read the file(s) listed under **File(s)** in the finding above.
         Read enough context (20-50 lines around each line reference) to
         understand the surrounding code.

Step 2 - Implement the fix using Edit (preferred) or Write. Keep the change
         minimal and focused.

Step 3 - Run \`./gradlew :client:compileJava\` via Bash. If it fails, read
         the error, fix it, and retry. Do not proceed past this step until
         compileJava succeeds.

Step 4 - Edit REVIEW_FINDINGS.md to prefix the finding's title with
         \`[DONE]\` as described in constraint 5.

Step 5 - Stop. Output a one-line summary of what you changed.

Begin now.
