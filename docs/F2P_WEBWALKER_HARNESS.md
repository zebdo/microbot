# F2P Web Walker Harness

This harness runs live in-game webwalker regression routes for a fresh F2P account after Tutorial Island. It uses `Rs2Walker.walkWithState(...)` for both setup movement and the route under test.

The Microbot CLI may be used while investigating a failure to read state, nearby objects, nearby NPCs, screenshots, or logs. Do not use `./microbot-cli walk` or any other manual movement command to place the player at the destination.

## Run

Full fail-fast suite:

```bash
scripts/run-f2p-webwalker-harness.sh
```

Specific route:

```bash
scripts/run-f2p-webwalker-harness.sh F2P-15
```

The script compiles the client, starts RuneLite in test mode with AutoLogin enabled by `TestRunnerPlugin`, runs the hidden `F2P Web Walker Harness` plugin, and writes:

```text
~/.runelite/test-results/f2p-webwalker/result.json
```

Override the timeout or output directory:

```bash
MICROBOT_WEBWALKER_TIMEOUT_MS=2400000 \
MICROBOT_WEBWALKER_LEG_TIMEOUT_MS=300000 \
MICROBOT_WEBWALKER_OUTPUT_DIR=/tmp/f2p-webwalker \
scripts/run-f2p-webwalker-harness.sh F2P-15
```

The runner forwards route settings through `microbot.test.webwalker.*` system properties because the Gradle `runTest` task only propagates `microbot.test.*` properties into the launched client JVM.

## Agent Loop

1. Run the full suite.
2. If a route fails, inspect `result.json`, `~/.runelite/logs/client.log`, and optional observational CLI output such as `./microbot-cli state`, `objects`, `npcs`, or screenshots.
3. Understand whether the failure was setup movement or the route itself.
4. Patch the walker or supporting path data.
5. Rebuild and rerun only the failed route, for example `scripts/run-f2p-webwalker-harness.sh F2P-15`.
6. Once the failed route passes, rerun the full suite.
