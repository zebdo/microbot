# Entity Guides

Per-entity gotchas, footguns, and patterns for LLMs (and humans) writing or modifying Microbot code.

Each guide lists known pitfalls when working with one specific game entity type. **Read the relevant guide before implementing or modifying any code that interacts with that entity** — these documents capture lessons learned from real bugs that escaped review because the assumption was invisible at the call site.

## Guides

| Entity | File | When to read |
|--------|------|--------------|
| Items (inventory, bank, ground, equipment, shops) | [items.md](items.md) | Any code calling `Rs2Inventory`, `Rs2Bank`, `Rs2Equipment`, `Rs2GroundItem`, `Rs2Shop`, or `Rs2DepositBox` interaction helpers, or any helper that takes a list of item names and applies a single action to all of them |

## Format

Each entity guide is a numbered list of gotchas. Each entry follows this structure:

```
## N. <Short rule, imperative voice>

<One-paragraph explanation of the rule.>

**Why this matters:** <The concrete failure mode — ideally a real bug or near-miss — that motivated the rule.>

**Pattern to follow:**

<Code snippet showing the wrong way and the right way.>

**Where this applies:** <List of utility classes / call sites this rule covers.>

**Defensive check:** <Optional — assertion / unit-test pattern that catches violations at PR time, not in production.>
```

## Adding a new guide

1. Create `<entity>.md` in this directory using the format above.
2. Add the guide to the table at the top of this file.
3. Cross-reference it from `AGENTS.md` (top-level) and `runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client/plugins/microbot/CLAUDE.md` so future agent invocations discover it via the entry-point docs.

## Adding a new gotcha to an existing guide

Append a new numbered entry. Do **not** delete or rewrite existing entries unless they are factually wrong — each entry corresponds to a real failure mode and removing it loses the institutional memory of why the rule exists.
