# Movement Gotchas

## 1. Do not recurse on failed minimap clicks without changing the click target

`Rs2Walker.processWalk` holds the walker lock while processing a path. If a minimap click is rejected because the calculated point is outside the minimap clip, immediately recursing with the same target can spin forever while still holding the lock. Shrink the click target toward the player or otherwise change the condition before retrying.

**Why this matters:** Quest steps that walk to a nearby object can repeatedly calculate a valid path but never move, starving other walk requests because the walker lock is never released.

**Pattern to follow:**

```java
WorldPoint clickTarget = getPointWithWallDistance(targetWp);
boolean clicked = Rs2Walker.walkMiniMap(clickTarget);
if (!clicked)
{
	clicked = walkMiniMapToward(clickTarget, playerLoc, MINIMAP_REACH_EUCLIDEAN - 1);
}
```

**Where this applies:** `Rs2Walker`, `Rs2MiniMap`, and shortest-path walking loops.

**Defensive check:** When debugging stalls, compare pathfinder logs with `./microbot-cli state`. A repeating valid path with an unchanged player position usually means the click layer failed after pathing succeeded.

## 2. Probe raw path obstacles before declaring the walker stuck

Path smoothing can collapse many adjacent raw path tiles into one minimap waypoint. Some doors and gates are not represented as blocking collision in the pathfinder map, so the smoothed segment may legally cross them while hiding the exact tile the object handler needs to inspect. Run nearby raw-path door/object checks as soon as the raw path is longer than the smoothed path and the obstacle is in scene range; do not wait for `stuckCount` to increment first.

**Why this matters:** A walk from Varrock castle's upper floors toward Varrock fountain can descend correctly, then stall at the plane-1 castle door because the smoothed waypoint skips over the door tile and the normal per-segment door check never sees it.

**Pattern to follow:**

```java
if (rawPath != null && path != null && rawPath.size() > path.size()
        && handleNearbyRawPathSceneObjects(rawPath, HANDLER_RANGE)) {
    doorOrTransportResult = true;
}
```

**Where this applies:** `Rs2Walker`, `PathSmoother`, and shortest-path obstacle handling.

**Defensive check:** When a path stalls beside a visible door while the pathfinder reports a complete route, compare raw and smoothed path lengths; if the raw path is longer, verify nearby raw-path obstacle probing happens before stall recovery.

## 3. Match wall doors by crossed edge, not nearby tile

Wall-object doors block the edge between the wall object's tile and the neighboring tile indicated by its orientation. Raw-path segment probes must only treat a wall door as relevant when the path segment actually transitions across that edge. Do not match a wall door merely because the path starts on, ends on, or passes near one side of the door.

**Why this matters:** At Draynor Manor's east/back door, the player can stand on the south-side door tile and need to walk southwest into the room. A broad "door near segment" match repeatedly re-opens the back door instead of allowing the next minimap walk step to run.

**Pattern to follow:**

```java
WorldPoint doorTile = wall.getWorldLocation();
WorldPoint blockedNeighbor = getWallDoorNeighborPoint(wall.getOrientationA(), doorTile);
return isDoorEdgeTransition(previousPathTile, nextPathTile, doorTile, blockedNeighbor);
```

**Where this applies:** `Rs2Walker.handleNearbyRawPathSceneObjects`, `Rs2Walker.findDoorNearSegment`, and any wall-door probe that uses `WallObject.getOrientationA()`.

**Defensive check:** Add a unit test for a path starting on the door's blocked-neighbor tile and moving away from the door; it must return false.

## 4. Do not raw-probe doors while the player is already moving

Raw-path scene-object probing is a recovery aid for smoothed paths that hide nearby obstacles. Once a door interaction has started movement, let that movement settle or reach the door edge before probing again. Re-running raw probes while the player is still moving can repeatedly interact with the same door and prevent the normal minimap/path step from taking over.

**Why this matters:** When leaving Draynor Manor through the east/back door, the walker can click the door, start moving toward it, then immediately re-enter raw-path probing and click the same door again instead of continuing through the path outside.

**Pattern to follow:**

```java
if (Rs2Player.isMoving()) {
    return false;
}
waitForDoorInteractionProgress(fromWp, toWp);
```

**Where this applies:** `Rs2Walker.handleNearbyRawPathSceneObjects`, door handlers that call `Rs2GameObject.interact`, and any recovery logic that recurses into `processWalk`.

**Defensive check:** In live testing, a door should produce one interaction followed by movement/path progress, not repeated `Raw path door handler resolved obstacle` messages every tick while the player is moving.

## 5. Suppress the inverse adjacent transport after crossing a same-plane door

Some doors are represented in `transports.tsv` as two adjacent same-plane transports, one for each direction. After the walker clicks one side and arrives on the other, immediately accepting the inverse transport can bounce the player back through the same door instead of letting the next minimap step continue away from it. Mark both tiles of a successful adjacent same-plane transport as recently handled for a short window.

**Why this matters:** Leaving Draynor Manor through the east/back door can alternate between `3123,3360,0` and `3123,3361,0`, repeatedly logging raw-path/current-tile transport handling and burning the route timeout before walking back to Draynor.

**Pattern to follow:**

```java
boolean reachedDestination = sleepUntil(() -> atTransportDestination(transport), 5000);
if (reachedDestination && isAdjacentSamePlaneTransport(transport)) {
    markStationaryDoorOpened(transport.getOrigin());
    markStationaryDoorOpened(transport.getDestination());
}
```

**Where this applies:** `Rs2Walker.handleTransports`, current-tile transport recovery, raw-path transport probing, and bidirectional same-plane door/gate transports.

**Defensive check:** A successful adjacent same-plane transport should be followed by a minimap/path step away from the doorway, not by alternating `Raw path transport handler` and `Current-tile transport handler` logs for the same two tiles.

## 6. Recalculate after long-distance object transports

Not every large map transition changes plane or uses a teleport type. Some object transports, such as the Varrock Sewers ladder, remain on plane 0 while jumping between coordinate bands. After a successful object interaction reaches one of these destinations, run the normal transport finalizer so the shortest path is rebuilt from the new location.

**Why this matters:** A route from Varrock Sewers back to a surface origin can climb the ladder successfully, then continue using a path that was calculated from the underground coordinate band. The walker may drift off path or exit during setup even though the transport itself worked.

**Pattern to follow:**

```java
if (reachedDestination) {
    markAdjacentSamePlaneTransportHandled(transport, object);
    return finishHandledTransport(transport);
}
```

**Where this applies:** `Rs2Walker.handleTransports` object interactions and any object-transport handler that waits for the destination tile directly.

**Defensive check:** Same-plane object transports with a large `distanceTo2D` delta should produce a fresh pathfinder start near the post-transport player location before the next minimap step.

## 7. Model missing collision edges before tuning walker retries

Some static collision gaps are specific edges, not whole tiles. If the pathfinder repeatedly routes through a visible fence/wall and the live client keeps clicking fallback tiles near that boundary, add an explicit blocked edge to pathfinding and smoothing instead of trying to solve it with longer timeouts or broader minimap fallback.

**Why this matters:** The Varrock Palace garden south fence can be missing from the bundled collision map near `3229..3241,3472 -> 3471`. A no-agility F2P route to the Varrock Sewers manhole can walk around the trellis correctly, then stall against that garden boundary because the path says the south edge is traversable.

**Pattern to follow:**

```java
if (config.isBlockedTransportEdge(node.packedPosition, neighborPacked)) {
    continue;
}
```

**Where this applies:** `CollisionMap.getNeighbors`, `PathSmoother.lineOfSight`, and any path data correction where only one edge between adjacent tiles is invalid.

**Defensive check:** Add a core pathfinder regression from the observed stuck tile; assert neither the raw path nor smoothed path crosses the blocked edge, and that the route still reaches the original destination.

## 8. Do not click a visible endpoint before honoring pending route interactions

An endpoint being visible on the minimap does not mean it is the next correct click. If the computed shortest path reaches that endpoint through an intermediate door, gate, transport, shortcut, ladder, or other route object, the walker must process the first route interaction before issuing a direct endpoint click.

**Why this matters:** From Varrock Palace, a destination such as `3229,3473,0` can be visible on the minimap while the shorter route requires opening the palace doors first. Clicking the endpoint lets the game choose a longer collision-valid detour and bypasses the webwalker's route.

**Pattern to follow:**

```java
if (handleNearbyRawPathSceneObjects(rawPath, HANDLER_RANGE)) {
    return true;
}
if (!hasPendingExplicitTransportStepBeforeArrival(rawPath, target, distance)
        && !localRouteDetoursFromComputedRoute(rawPath, end, DIRECT_CLICK_MAX_DISTANCE)) {
    walkMiniMap(end);
}
```

**Where this applies:** `Rs2Walker.walkWithStateInternal`, short local walk kick-starts, final/minimap endpoint clicks, and any future fast-path that bypasses normal path iteration.

**Defensive check:** Reproduce with closed Varrock Palace doors toward `3229,3473,0`; the first action should target the door or route waypoint, not the final endpoint tile.

## 9. Preserve interrupts so walker cancellation stops waits immediately

Ctrl+X and script shutdown cancel the active walk task with `Future.cancel(true)` and clear the walker target. Shared sleep/poll helpers must preserve the interrupted flag and stop polling when interruption is observed; otherwise the walker can continue through several timeout cycles before noticing the cleared target.

**Why this matters:** A user pressing Ctrl+X expects the webwalker to stop issuing route actions immediately. If `InterruptedException` is swallowed, long waits in object, transport, dialogue, or animation handling can keep cycling until their normal timeout elapses.

**Pattern to follow:**

```java
try {
    Thread.sleep(delayMs);
} catch (InterruptedException ignored) {
    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
}
while (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted() && !condition.getAsBoolean()) {
    sleep(pollMs);
}
```

**Where this applies:** `Global.sleep*`, `Global.sleepUntil*`, `Rs2Walker.setTarget(null)`, and any walker helper that waits after clicking a door, shortcut, transport, or minimap tile.

**Defensive check:** Start a long webwalk, press Ctrl+X during movement or a route-object wait, and verify no additional path recalculations or route-object interactions occur after the cancel log.

## 10. Do not treat reachable endpoint tiles as proof that a gate edge is open

Local reachability answers whether individual tiles can be reached within the sampled area; it does not prove that the computed path edge between two reachable tiles can be crossed without opening a gate, door, stile, or similar route object. Before skipping door handling, issuing a direct short minimap/checkpoint click, or yielding to an in-flight interim minimap target, scan the nearby remaining route for door-like scene objects that sit on the route segment. Include one or two raw edges before the closest path index; when the player is slightly off-path near a gate, the closest raw tile can already be on the far side of the gate edge. For diagonal hops beside small gates, also check the two cardinal sub-steps of the diagonal; the gate edge may sit on one of those sub-steps even when the direct diagonal segment does not equal the wall edge. Do not skip door probing just because the edge or object is catalogued as a transport when it is an `Open Gate` / door-like object transport. A raw-route scan may notice a future gate early, but the actual object interaction must still be range-gated against that gate edge before treating it as handled.

**Why this matters:** A short route near the Lumbridge farm allotment can correctly choose the gate as the shortest path, but the walker may see both sides as valid reachable tiles and click the minimap endpoint. The game then routes around the fence instead of opening the gate.

**Pattern to follow:**

```java
int scanStart = Math.max(0, closestRawIndex - 2);
if (bothEndpointTilesReachable
        && !hasDoorLikeSceneObjectOnSegment(from, to, playerLoc, HANDLER_RANGE)) {
    continue;
}
if (doorOpenedButPlayerDidNotTraverse) {
    // Only count this as success if the nudge actually reaches/crosses the door edge.
    tryDoorEdgeCrossNudge(from, to, currentTarget);
}
if (hasPendingDoorLikeSceneObjectBeforeDirectClick(rawPath, path, playerLoc, DIRECT_CLICK_MAX_DISTANCE)
        || handlePendingDoorBeforeRouteClick(rawPath, path, i, targetIdx, smoothedToRaw, timeoutMs,
        attemptedDoorEdgesThisPass, playerLoc)
        || handlePendingDoorNearRawPath(rawPath, timeoutMs, attemptedDoorEdgesThisPass, playerLoc, 2, 14)
        || handlePendingDoorDuringInterim(rawPath, timeoutMs, attemptedDoorEdgesThisPass, playerLoc)) {
    return WalkerState.MOVING;
}
```

**Where this applies:** `Rs2Walker.tryDirectShortWalk`, route checkpoint/minimap click selection, unreachable-smoothed-tile recovery, interim minimap movement waits, post-open door-edge nudges, `Rs2Walker.handleDoorsInRawSegment`, and any future optimization that skips route-object probing because tiles look locally reachable.

**Defensive check:** Reproduce from the Lumbridge farm road toward a target southwest of the allotment with both gates closed; the route should open each gate as it enters handler range, not stay in `interim-in-flight` until the server path has already routed around the field.

## 11. Clear sticky minimap interim targets outside the click branch

Sticky interim targets prevent click thrash while the player is moving toward a minimap checkpoint, but they are only useful while the checkpoint is still ahead. Clear them at the start of each walk pass when the player is already within the close threshold, the target is on another plane, or the checkpoint has aged out. Also clear them when stall-recalc fires, otherwise the replan can inherit the same stale checkpoint and spin without issuing a new movement command.

**Why this matters:** Long post-transport routes through cluttered areas can stop one tile from the sticky interim target. If the next pass does not enter the checkpoint-click branch, the stale interim remains in diagnostics and each stall-recalc repeats the same state until the tail iteration limit exits.

**Pattern to follow:**

```java
if (shouldClearInterimTarget(interimTargetWp, Rs2Player.getWorldLocation(), interimSetAtMs,
        interimLastProgressAtMs, nowMs)) {
    clearInterimTarget("close-or-expired");
}
if (isStuckTooLong()) {
    clearInterimTarget("stall-recalc");
    recalculatePath();
}
```

**Where this applies:** `Rs2Walker.processWalk`, recovery minimap clicks, post-transport walking, and any future logic that stores a sticky route checkpoint across loop iterations.

**Defensive check:** Reproduce a long route after the Falador crumbling-wall shortcut toward Ardougne through the dead-tree field; if the player reaches one tile from the interim checkpoint, the next pass should log `interim_clear` and select a fresh movement target instead of repeating `STALL_RECALC` until `tail_max`.

For long open routes, retarget before the player fully stops when they are already close to the interim checkpoint, and keep normal minimap clicks slightly inside the observed minimap edge. This reduces visible stop/start pauses and outside-clip fallback clicks without reintroducing rapid click thrash.

## 12. Do not let optimistic recovery override unresolved door blockers

Unreachable-tile recovery is useful for outdoor false negatives, but in tight rooms it can fight the door resolver. If a route edge still has a door-like scene object on or adjacent to the raw path, suppress broad minimap recovery and let the door scanners retry after their normal cooldowns. Do not permanently blacklist a path-adjacent fallback door just because one attempt traversed the wrong way; in small door clusters the same object may be the correct blocker again once the player has moved to the other side.

**Why this matters:** In POH-style tight rooms with several doors close together, a fallback door click can move the player away from the intended route. If that door tile is session-blacklisted and optimistic recovery keeps clicking route tiles beyond the blocker, the walker loops around the room until a user manually opens the final door.

**Pattern to follow:**

```java
if (tryResolvePathAdjacentBlocker(...)) {
    return MOVING;
}
if (hasUnresolvedDoorLikeObjectNearRawPath(...)) {
    return MOVING; // retry door handling next pass; do not broad-click recovery
}
clickOptimisticRecoveryTarget();
```

**Where this applies:** `Rs2Walker.processWalk` unreachable-tile handling, `tryResolvePathAdjacentBlocker`, and any fallback that issues minimap recovery clicks after door/path-adjacent scans fail.

**Defensive check:** Reproduce a route through a small room with three nearby doors and a POH portal. The walker should retry the route-door blocker and avoid repeated `unreachable optimistic recovery` loops around the room; it should not need the user to manually open the final door.

## 13. Stall recalculation must also issue fresh movement

Recalculating a path after a stationary stall is not enough by itself. If the player is idle and the next loop still cannot enter a normal click branch, repeated `STALL_RECALC` logs can continue forever until a user manually nudges the player. After clearing stale interim state and refreshing the route, issue a conservative minimap click along the reachable raw route so the server pathfinder gets a new movement command immediately. On active long routes, also nudge after a short stationary idle window, around a few ticks, instead of waiting for the full stall threshold.

**Why this matters:** Long routes can stop on a tile with no combat, animation, or interaction. Repeated stall recalcs refresh pathfinding state but leave the character standing still, so the route only resumes after manual movement changes the local path context.

**Pattern to follow:**

```java
if (isRouteActive() && playerIsIdleForShortWindow()) {
    tryIssueRouteRecoveryClick(rawPath, path, target);
    continue;
}
if (isStuckTooLong()) {
    clearInterimTarget("stall-recalc");
    setTarget(target);
    if (playerIsIdle()) {
        tryIssueRouteRecoveryClick(rawPath, path, target);
    }
    continue;
}
```

**Where this applies:** `Rs2Walker.processWalk` stall-recalc handling and any future stale-state recovery that clears route state while the player is idle.

**Defensive check:** Start a long route and observe a stationary pause. A short idle pause should log `active route idle nudge`; if it reaches full stall recalc, the next log sequence should include `stall recovery click` and a position delta, not another idle-only `STALL_RECALC` loop at the same tile.

After a handled transport, avoid expensive path-adjacent or raw transport scans on ordinary open-ground segments unless a nearby planned transport or recent door attempt exists. Those scans are recovery tools, and on long outdoor routes a no-op scan can add several seconds before the next minimap click.

For long-route minimap walking, let the next checkpoint selection happen before the current minimap target is fully consumed. Waiting until the player is only a few tiles from the interim makes the walker visibly stop before issuing the next click; handing off at a moderate remaining distance keeps movement continuous without rapid re-clicking. If an interim clears as close and no nearby route door/transport is pending, issue the next route-aligned continuation click immediately instead of waiting for idle-nudge recovery.

Continuation clicks that keep an active route moving should be tail-exempt like `interim-in-flight`; otherwise very long routes can exhaust `MAX_PROCESS_WALK_TAIL_ITERATIONS` while still making progress and trigger an unnecessary auto-retry.

Sticky interim targets should also clear when route-index progress goes stale. If the player keeps moving but the closest path index does not advance for `INTERIM_PROGRESS_TIMEOUT_MS`, treat the checkpoint as stale and select a fresh route-aligned target instead of waiting for max-age expiry.

When a route-following minimap click is outside the minimap clip, fallback clicks must stay on the raw path. A generic "reachable tile closer to target" fallback can select a tile far away from the route in open areas, especially near the final destination.

For adjacent same-plane shortcuts, do not treat any movement away from the origin as success. Some shortcuts, such as stepping stones, can fail and place the player on a fallback tile; once the player is settled away from the expected destination, stop the landing wait and replan from the actual tile.

## 14. Execute the exact transport selected by the pathfinder

Multiple catalog transports can share an origin or destination while having different requirements, costs, or actions. Keep the chosen `Transport` on the route edge and dispatch that exact instance. Do not reconstruct the choice later by scanning every transport at the same world point.

Catalog rows are also an execution contract: a row may enter automated pathfinding only when `TransportExecutionRegistry` confirms that the walker has enough metadata and a handler for its family. New upstream rows should fail closed until their interaction can be verified.

**Why this matters:** Re-selecting at execution time can use a more expensive or unavailable alternative even though the pathfinder evaluated another edge. Treating every parsed row as executable can leave the walker repeatedly attempting a transport whose widget or POH facility is unsupported.

**Defensive check:** Add two transports with the same origin and destination but different identities and costs. The route steps and walker lookup must return the lower-cost instance selected by the pathfinder. A catalog row without executable object metadata must be absent from the usable transport set.
