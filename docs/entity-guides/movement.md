# Movement Gotchas

## 1. Do not recurse on failed minimap clicks without changing the click target

`Rs2Walker.processWalk` holds the walker lock while processing a path. If a minimap click is rejected because the calculated point is outside the minimap clip, immediately recursing with the same target can spin forever while still holding the lock. Shrink the click target toward the player or otherwise change the condition before retrying.

**Why this matters:** Quest steps that walk to a nearby object can repeatedly calculate a valid path but never move, starving other walk requests because the walker lock is never released.

**Pattern to follow:**

```java
WorldPoint clickTarget = getPointWithWallDistance(targetWp);
boolean clicked = Rs2Walker.walkMiniMap(clickTarget);
if (!clicked)
{
	clicked = walkMiniMapToward(clickTarget, playerLoc, MINIMAP_REACH_EUCLIDEAN - 1);
}
```

**Where this applies:** `Rs2Walker`, `Rs2MiniMap`, and shortest-path walking loops.

**Defensive check:** When debugging stalls, compare pathfinder logs with `./microbot-cli state`. A repeating valid path with an unchanged player position usually means the click layer failed after pathing succeeded.

## 2. Probe raw path obstacles before declaring the walker stuck

Path smoothing can collapse many adjacent raw path tiles into one minimap waypoint. Some doors and gates are not represented as blocking collision in the pathfinder map, so the smoothed segment may legally cross them while hiding the exact tile the object handler needs to inspect. Run nearby raw-path door/object checks as soon as the raw path is longer than the smoothed path and the obstacle is in scene range; do not wait for `stuckCount` to increment first.

**Why this matters:** A walk from Varrock castle's upper floors toward Varrock fountain can descend correctly, then stall at the plane-1 castle door because the smoothed waypoint skips over the door tile and the normal per-segment door check never sees it.

**Pattern to follow:**

```java
if (rawPath != null && path != null && rawPath.size() > path.size()
        && handleNearbyRawPathSceneObjects(rawPath, HANDLER_RANGE)) {
    doorOrTransportResult = true;
}
```

**Where this applies:** `Rs2Walker`, `PathSmoother`, and shortest-path obstacle handling.

**Defensive check:** When a path stalls beside a visible door while the pathfinder reports a complete route, compare raw and smoothed path lengths; if the raw path is longer, verify nearby raw-path obstacle probing happens before stall recovery.
